I am a Computer Engineering Ph.D. student under [Heiner Litz](https://people.ucsc.edu/~hlitz/) at U.C. Santa Cruz. My research interests are in computer architecture, operating systems, and storage systems, with a focus in data center optimizations. I am a member of the [SSRC](https://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu).
