My research interests are computer architecture, operating systems, and storage systems, with a focus on data center
optimizations. Currently I am researching storage accelerator applications in computational genomics in collaboration
with the [UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute](https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/).

For an interesting paper in this field I suggest: [Y. Turakhia, G. Bejerano, and W. J. Dally, “Darwin: A Genomics Co-processor Provides up to 15,000X Acceleration on Long Read Assembly,” in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems  - ASPLOS ’18, Williamsburg, VA, USA, 2018, pp. 199–213.](https://stanford.edu/~yatisht/pubs/darwin.pdf)
