      <description>My original Jekyll-based site stopped working for some reason. Rather than try to figure out what was going on with it, I decided to try out some alternative site generators. I&amp;rsquo;d heard about Hugo a bit so I decided to give it a try. The other thing I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to do is start posting about all the various tech things I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, as well as interesting talks I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, papers I&amp;rsquo;ve read, and that sort of thing.</description>
